			I've been telling myself that I've wanted to get this project done for months now, and finally sucked it up and got around to it! It's in part a way for me to document the places I've been, and in another part a source of inspiration for me to travel more (so much unpinned space!). And of course, it's a cute piece of wall decor. You can find something like this online but it will cost more and be less fun/customized to you. Here's how to do it! 
		</p>

		<h4>Materials</h4>

		<p>I chose to use a 20" x 30" foam board (Walmart) for the cutout of my map. I also found my old square cork panels from college and decided to use those as a backing - you don't need a backing at all, but I wanted it to be more portable (vs. many pieces). In retrospect, it might've made more sense to use cork for the map (although it would've been harder to paint)...but anyway, it turned out okay! I also got some acrylic paint from Walmart in my favorite color, and a knife/exacto knife to cut everything out. And you'll want some small, cute pushpins to make your mark (Target).</p>

		<h4>Make a template of a world map.</h4>
		<p>Unless you are an excellent free-hander or don't care for accuracy, I'd suggest getting a template of the world first, which is what I did. I just googled "world map cork", printed it out to scale (onto 8 sheets of paper for me), and taped the sheets together. Obviously not everything is going to be to scale, but that's okay! It's also up to you what you want to include; the map I printed out didn't include some islands like Hawaii and Taiwan... but I wanted to include them so those I free handed. Do keep in mind that the more pieces, the lengthier the cutting/positioning process. I outlined everything in marker so it'd be easier for me to cut out, and labeled the template pieces to better keep track of them.</p>

		<h4>Trace it onto the foam board.</h4>
		<p>Cut out the template pieces and trace them onto the foam board. I kept them mostly in the right positions, just to minimize confusion about where all the little islands go (I am clearly no geography expert).</p>

		<h4>Cut it out.</h4>
		<p>This is the most time-consuming, patience-requiring part...basically, just carefully use the knife to cut out all the pieces...meanwhile, watch a movie or two? Get reflective? Or get a really conversational friend on the phone?</p>
		<center><img src="map4.JPG" style="width: 85%;"></center>

		<h4>Paint it.</h4>
		<p>And this is the most fun part! I painted along the thickness of the pieces as well to cover up the white insides of the foam board.</p>

		<h4>Decorate the backboard.</h4>
		<p>Or maybe <i>this</i> is the most fun part? I decided to splatter paint - I'd never splatter painted before, but the great part about it is that it's supposed to be messy! Mine definitely turned out that way.</p>

		<h4>Super glue everything into position.</h4>
		<p>Ta-da!</p>
		<center><img src="map7.JPG" style="width: 85%;"></center>

		<p>All you have left to do is pin in the places you've been (or the places you want to go?). Set it up wherever you want - I think the best options are to either pin it into a wall (which is what I did), or stand it up on your desk to lean against a wall. And there you have it!</p>
