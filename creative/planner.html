		<p>
			Those who know me might know that I created a planner at the start of 2017, in which I designed all the pages and had it printed at blurb.com. I loved it at first and used it for a while, but eventually strayed from doing so. I came to dislike the design and the requirement for so many <i>details</i> (even though I'd thought I wanted that!).
		</p>
		<p>
			So I took on the ambition of trying again! This time with a redesign, and binding the book myself to have more freedom with the page design, quality, and details that blurb.com restricted me from. It's not perfect, but if I do say so myself, I think it turned out pretty well! We'll have to wait and see if I keep up with it. But here's a little lowdown of how I put it together:
		</p>

		<h4>Design the pages.</h4>
		<p>I started out by writing down what I wanted to include, and then making a rough sketch of what I wanted to do (though it eventually strayed from my original vision). Because I don't own Photoshop (nor have the desire to purchase it), I used Inkscape which is another free image editing/design program. Once I got the design down, it was just a lot of time to complete pages for an entire year (= motivation to keep it simple). Then, laying them out appropriately and putting them all together using Microsoft Publisher.</p>

		<h4>Print the pages.</h4>
		<p>I had my pages printed at Staples to get it on nicer quality paper than I have on hand at home, and with better printing quality than my home printers could produce. </p>

		<h4>Fold and arrange the pages.</h4>
		<p>I folded all the pages in half to achieve a ~ 5 x 8 inch sized planner that I prefer. I decided on signatures of 4 pages each (groups of 4 pages folded together) and arranged the pages accordingly. Obviously, this took some foresight when arranging the pages to be printed.</p>

		<h4>Stitch the pages together.</h4>
		<p>I followed "Sea Lemon"'s instructions on creating the text block (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGQ5P8QVHSg">here</a>) with some thread that I waxed with beeswax, then used fabric/paper glue to better hold together the stitched edge.</p>

		<h4>Round the corners of the pages.</h4>
		<p>Just for a little touch of "professional"!</p>

		<h4>Prep the cover.</h4>
		<p>I bought some fabric and metallic paint for the cover, and ribbon for the page holder, and painted the basic design I wanted on the cover. </p>

		<h4>Put together the cover.</h4>
		<p>I took some cardboard off old notebooks around the house to create the front and back covers, and some cardstock for the spine, and glued them onto the fabric.</p>

		<h4>Add finishing touches!</h4>
		<p>Once I glued the textblock into the cover, I added some touches to the cover design, and added some metallic embellishments to the fabric design on the front and back.</p>
