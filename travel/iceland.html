		So...I went to Iceland? I haven't gotten over it feeling a bit odd to say (although, I think it'll be less and less so as the country grows in tourism, which it surely will). It was my first week long trip in a winter-y destination, and we rented a car and drove all the way from the west to the southeastern end of the country. While it was cold for my California body, it was one of the most memorable trips I've taken. Here are some of the reasons why:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>The emptiness.</strong> I found it hilarious when we entered any "national park" because I felt like the entire country was a national park in itself. Outside of Reykjavik, most everywhere we went was totally empty. It would be so surprising to see any signs of life for any long stretch of time, especially in West Iceland. A "town" would be a street that we could drive through in a few minutes. Coming from city living, I wasn't used to this at all. Add in the massive amounts of snow, and most of the time, I just felt like I was in another world.</li>
			<li><strong>The sights.</strong> Where else in the world can you drive from hot spring to massive waterfall to geyser to glacier back to massive waterfall? (Maybe Alaska? Antarctica?) Any photo of the nature found in Iceland speaks for itself, so all I can say is that being able to experience it firsthand was both surreal and a privilege.</li>
			<li><strong>The sky.</strong> When we visited in February, we were lucky enough to have a decent amount of daylight, with the sun rising around 8, and setting around 6 (vs. in January where the daylight is something like 11am-4pm). But the sunrises/sunsets took probably a good 2 hours, meaning 2 hours of a low-sitting sun and glorious golden lighting every morning and evening. The colors of the sky during these hours were amazing. The clarity of the night sky was insane too, from the number of stars we could see to the crisp outline of the moon.</li>
			<li><strong>The horses!</strong> We came across horses along the side of the roads nearly everywhere we drove in the country, and, well, what can I say? They were just so cute! Short horses with luxurious hair, of all different colors, sometimes (a bit pitifully) digging through the snow for grass to graze on.</li>
			<li><strong>The Northern Lights.</strong> Like many people, we essentially went to Iceland for this, which the winter darkness is perfect for. The visibility of the lights is totally weather dependent though - the first time we saw it was from the plane getting into Reykjavik (the pilot pointed it out, and everyone not at a window seat got up to take turns looking out the tiny windows), where it just looked like a vague green haze. The second time we saw it when we were in the south of Iceland, it was more visible but still mostly a green hazy streak across the sky, with the clouds covering it up soon after. On our last night, we were lucky enough to catch a cloud-free night with the lights shining strong - and finally, we actually saw the lights <em>dance</em>, lighting up the sky from one end to the other. It seriously looked like an angel, or spirit, walking across the sky. Granted, to the naked eye it looks nothing like what you get on Google images, which are captured with long exposures/a great deal of editing. Still, it was something magical. I never dreamed that I'd be able to see the Northern Lights so soon, but there's something to cross off my bucket list.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Things I learned (and to note for anyone planning a trip there):</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Iceland is <em>not</em> a budget destination.</strong> Of course, I was lured in by the $280 round trip flight from WOW air - which doesn't include carry-on or check-in luggage, or any food for the 8 hour flight. Even with those extra costs, though, the flight was still relatively very cheap (and there was a surprising amount of legroom?). What was worse was everything else actually <em>in</em> Iceland! The hostel we stayed in cost about $35/night (vs. me being used to ~$15/night hostels in mainland Europe), a latte at any cafe was $5-6, and worst of all, gas was equivalent to $7.50/gallon. Granted, the hostels, cafes, and really everywhere we went was comfortable and hip...but definitely not luxurious. And this was off-season, too! We tried to save money by grocery shopping and cooking every night, but even so, I wouldn't call the trip a steal by any means.</li>
			<li><strong>Drive - it's worth it.</strong> Basically, to get around the country of Iceland, you have two options (besides hitchhiking): drive it yourself, or go with a tour bus. Adding up the cost of the rental car and gas (mostly gas), the cost might be comparable - but the flexibility we had with driving ourselves was so important! Being able to stop on the side of the road to hang out with some horses, to stay as long as we wanted at any sight (far longer than those on tours), and to be able to experience the beautiful nature in our own peace and quiet rather than in a group of 20+ people, was worth it. I was hesitant to rent a car at first - there are a ton of rental companies in Iceland, with some horror story-reviews online of customers being overcharged, or of just struggling with driving through winter weather. We ended up going with a seemingly relatively reputable company (Blue Car Rental), and we had no issues. Though many say you need a 4x4 in winter, we got along fine with our little Toyota Yaris - all cars in Iceland are required to have winter tires through the winter months, which helped a lot for us snow-inexperienced drivers.</li>
			<li><strong>Have no expectations of the weather.</strong> On our first day, we expected to land and head straight to the Blue Lagoon, where we would relax at the most popular hot spring/spa in Iceland, refreshing our skin with silica masks and steam from mineral water. Instead, we could barely walk from our bus to the entrance of the Blue Lagoon lobby against the wind shooting ice bits at our faces. But as the troopers (or just foolish tourists) we are, we went out there in swimsuits (along with all the other crazy tourists of all ages) and... still had wind shooting ice bits at our faces, with the lovely addition of strong hot spring water currents. Everyone around us, including us, was squinting with expressions of pain and wading through the water backs against the wind. Regardless, we still put our masks on, we still took our photos, and we laughed (when we weren't crying from the wind) the whole time. To add to this, all the roads in Iceland shut down due to the storm right when we were supposed to take a bus to the city, so we ended up napping in the swaying/wind-whistling bus for a few hours... It might not have been the relaxing experience we envisioned, but it sure was an experience to remember! Two days later, there was record snowfall in Reykjavik and our plans were thrown off for the day when the roads were closed again. After all this in the first few days, we had beautiful sunshine and snow-covered everything for the rest of our trip, as if to reward us. Main lesson: be adaptable and stay positive!</li>
		</ul>
		<p>With my first mirrorless camera that I picked up just before the trip (the Sony a5000), I decided to vlog throughout the trip, which you can watch in <a href="https://youtu.be/tI0hJi1jhv4" target="_blank">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/HYNwSKDsY9k" target="_blank">Part 2</a>.</p>

		<p>Overall, booking a flight to Iceland was one of the best spontaneous decisions I've made. It does feel nice to be home again and finally mostly recovered from jetlag...but only until the next adventure, right?</p>
