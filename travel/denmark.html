		<p>I am currently on the flight back from Copenhagen as I start this post on my phone - wait what?! Copenhagen? Didn't I just get to London? Yeah, pretty much. This past Saturday evening I got together with a few of my new UC friends and we decided to go somewhere for the few days we had off before orientation/enrollment at UCL started. We basically looked for the most affordable places we could fly to for the days we wanted, and somehow ended up with (if you know anything about Scandinavian countries vs. affordability, you'll laugh) Copenhagen, Denmark. Copenhagen was never on my list of places to go to, but one Google search and I was sold. So we booked our flight out Monday morning and I was set for my most spontaneous trip thus far!</p>

		<p style="padding-top: 10px;"><h4>Day 1:</h4></p>

		<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our flight was at 7AM and as with all budget airlines here (we flew Easyjet) we departed from a more distant airport, London Luton Airport - which meant we had to take the almost hourlong Thameslink train ride from the St. Pancras International Station to get to that airport. To put it shortly, I left my dorm at 3:15AM. Yes. Not a typo. But <i>anyway</i>, we landed into the very modern and clean Copenhagen Airport a short 1.5 hours later and purchased 72 hour Copenhagen Cards (about $90 USD) that included all public transportation and admission to nearly all the big attractions that we wanted to see, which I'd definitely recommend to future Copenhagen visitors who want to see the touristy things.</p>

		<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We then took a train/bus into the city and found our Air BnB... which apparently was described online as a bunker, and how literal that turned out to be (see photo).. Everything here is written/spoken in Danish by default (duh), with some more popular places having written English translations. Luckily though, most or all(?) of the Danish also know English which helped us a whole lot! For me, it was basically love at first sight of the adorable little houses and cobbled roads and more bikers in the streets than cars (and all the Danish people looking extremely fashionable/well put together, even on their bikes). It all looked like it was out of a storybook. And the biggest thing we noticed immediately was how calm and quiet everything and everyone was, keeping in mind this is a capital city. No wonder Copenhagen is considered one of the happiest cities in the world! There was such a feeling of peacefulness everywhere we went, so different from all the major cities I've experienced. Another thing we quickly learned that I unfortunately had not researched was that Copenhagen is a<em> really expensive city</em>. Apparently one of the most expensive in the world. Herp a derp. A tiny cup of coffee from any cafe was on average $5 (my most frequent purchase), and most everything was comparable to that. Plus they charge for tap water and apparently it's required by law for restaurants to include ice and a lemon wedge (what). I read somewhere that the minimum wage in Copenhagen is quite high (~$20 USD?), which is probably all you need to know. Anyway, the city turned out to be beautiful and amazing so I'm choosing to look past my crying wallet for now.</p>

		<p style="padding-left: 30px;">After grabbing a delicious and enormous sandwich from <strong>Smagsløget</strong>, we started our day of seeing the <strong>Rundetaarn</strong> and it's beautiful view at the top, <strong>Christiansborg Palace</strong> (where we missed the Queen by an hour), and the ever so famously photographed <strong>Nyhavn</strong>. While we were hoping to see Tivoli Gardens (which up until now I thought was just a restaurant in Reno's Eldorado hotel, but is apparently some sort of really old amusement park), we sadly came to find that it'd closed for the season just the day before! But no worries, we finished off the day in a super adorable, bookstore themed cafe across the university called <strong>Paludan</strong>.</p>

		<h4>Day 2:</h4>

		<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We took a train north to see the fairytale-like <strong>Frederiksborg Castle</strong> and very luckily missed the rain while we explored the perfectly kept gardens outside. The inside of the castle had its beauty too but was honestly a little too dimly lit to see anything! (E.g. we literally had to switch on a light ourselves in one of the rooms.) Then we made our way to the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) (has nothing to do with Louisiana, USA) where I got to finally experience what all the fuss about <strong>Yayoi Kusama</strong> was - her art turned out to be super fun and so awe inspiring, and we only waited 20-30 minutes to see her Infinity Mirrored Room (apparently a 3 hour wait in LA or NY). The museum itself was beautifully designed, and just on the coast across from Sweden. Sidenote: going to all these museums in Europe really makes me wish I knew more about history/art history (but maybe doesn't change the fact that I probably wouldn't survive in an art history class). We finished off this perfect day at Copenhagen Street Food (<strong>Papirøen</strong>), pretty much the cutest international street market I've ever seen.. and I finally fulfilled my ice cream craving. :)</p>

		<h4>Day 3:</h4>

		<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For our last day, we (after stopping by a cafe, of course) went to see the oh so famous Little Mermaid statue, followed by <strong>Grundtvig Church</strong> (in which we walked into a very interesting baby ceremony type thing that involved singing and dancing...??), some park with cool lines on the ground called <strong>Superkilen </strong>(thanks to the Instagram queen/friend of mine Ophelia), and the Experimentarium, an interactive "museum" where we were probably the only visitors over 10 years of age (but still fun!). And back at <strong>Papirøen</strong> for lunch, and yes, more ice cream for me. Apparently my new name to some is ice cream, which I suppose is okay.</p>

		<p>I'm so glad I made the spontaneous decision to go to Copenhagen, despite its expenses - everything about it was beautiful and cute at the same time, and all the people we interacted with were so friendly. The vibe of the city was one that I'd never experienced before. I get the inkling that if I lived there at this time in my life I might get bored with the quiet atmosphere, but as an escape from the crazy city life it was on point. Now back "home" to London. Whose dream am I living in?</p>
