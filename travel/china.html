		<p>To celebrate my official post-grad summer (a.k.a. putting off reality for 2 weeks longer), I had the pleasure of traveling throughout China for the first time with my family. The only other Asian country I'd ever been to was Vietnam, when I was 10 - so it'd been a while since I'd step foot in this part of the world. I initially had no desire to travel to China, envisioning it as an overcrowded, unclean, unpleasant place. My experience did not prove all of these wrong, but I found more value in traveling here than I had expected to.</p>

		<p>Here are some of my notable memories; of course, food in each city deserves some name dropping.</p>
		<h4>Beijing:</h4>
		<ul>
			<center><img src="image4155.png" style="width: 49%; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 7px;"><img src="image4145.png" style="width: 49%; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 7px; padding-left: 5px;""></center>
			<li><strong>Tobogganing down the Great Wall.</strong> Okay, not really in Beijing (~1.5 hours away), but a must do. The Great Wall has several visitor-friendly sections, and we chose to go to Mutianyu (supposedly more authentic and less crowded than the most visited section, Badaling). First, you take a cable car up and if you're as nervous about heights as me you'll feel, well, nervous. Once you get up there, the wall here is quite steep, which put not only my middle aged parents but also my 22 year old self through some intense exercise...but for some beautiful views! And the best part was taking the rackety (but seemingly safe) toboggans down a curvy metal slide until the bottom - the ride is pretty long and well worth it.</li>
			<li><strong>The liveliness of Houhai.</strong> Houhai is the center of nightlife in Beijing that my friend Addison took my brother and I to witness. Endless bars surround a calm lake, each flashing with colored lights and housing an aspiring Chinese singer or musical group. No really, I had never seen so many aspiring Chinese singers at once, many of whom sounded really good to me! We also got a chance to walk through a quiet, nearby hutong, which is a sort of traditional alleyway/courtyard-style living community.</li>
			<li><strong>Food</strong>: <em>Bayi Laoye</em> (Uyghur/Xinjiang cuisine) for its delicious grilled lamb dishes. <em>Wuyutai Tea</em> for its amazing <$1 green tea and jasmine tea soft serve ice creams and refreshing iced tea drinks.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Hong Kong:</h4>
		<ul>
			<center><img src="IMG_1744.JPG" style="width: 95%; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 7px;"></center>
			<li><strong>A Cantonese haven!</strong> I instantly felt more comfortable here being able to understand and speak Cantonese (conversationally). The intermixing of British culture made Hong Kong even more endearing for me, having studied in London last year.</li>
			<li><strong>The compactness of everything.</strong> We stayed at my uncle's place, on the 16th floor of a typical tall residence building in a rather central area of Hong Kong, and the entire living space may have been barely larger than my college apartment bedroom (and we had 4 people living here). But this compactness meant everything was really easy to get to, a walk or a quick metro ride away. Including the very beautiful (sunset and night, especially) Victoria Harbour separating the Kowloon peninsula from the Hong Kong island.</li>
			<li><strong>Food</strong>: <em>Tim Ho Wan</em>, a chain dim sum restaurant that is known to be one of the cheapest (one) Michelin star restaurants out there - and it didn't let me down! (Baked pork buns were divine.) <em>Kai Kai Dessert</em>, a tong sui place my uncle took us to - the type of Chinese dessert I've had growing up and to see the popularity of stores selling only this was beyond me! <em>Oddies foodies</em>, a hip, "instagrammable" dessert place, consisting of a mix of traditional egg waffles and delicious gelato (and other things if you order the special like we did).</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Shanghai:</h4>
		<ul>
			<center><img src="image4705.png" style="width: 95%; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 7px;"></center>
			<center><img src="IMG_1885.JPG" style="float: right; width: 35%; padding-right: 25px;"></center>
			<li><strong>A modernized mix of East and West.</strong> This was the most modern city of our trip, as could be seen in the landscape and the people. European colonial buildings on the Bund faced the skyline of financial towers across the river. The neighborhood of my cousin's condo and the AirBnB where we stayed was the former French Concession and now a haven for expats - full of trendy cafes, bars, etc. I'm not saying you would forget you were in China by any means (except during Happy Hour on a certain bar street or two), but it was interesting to see how global the city was, especially compared to my cousin's description of how it was (way, way less "developed") 10 years ago.</li>
			<li><strong>Food</strong>: <em>Jia Jia Tang Bao</em>, really delicious and affordable soup dumplings, probably the best I've had in my life! (and <em>Yang's Dumpling</em>, a chain store with fried also soup-y dumplings across the street.) <em>Lost Heaven,</em> a really nice Yunan cuisine restaurant nearby the Bund - my first time trying Yunan cuisine and it was delicious.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>And all throughout China, natural to the Asian girl in me, I fell in love with the availability of tea and milk tea (and Hong Kong style milk tea) everywhere, as well as cute designs (often including pandas) everywhere as well.</p>

		<p>There were some things, however, two weeks of travel did not get me used to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>The absence of cold drinking water.</strong> I came across <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-china-hot-water-20160313-story.html">this</a> article a few months ago and didn't think much of it, until it came to mind once again upon the strange reactions or straight up refusals to our requests for iced water in restaurants. Turns out, Chinese people drink hot water by default, rather than iced water that is the norm in the West. Canteens of tea or just hot water are everywhere and condensing, cold water-filled bottles are... well, nowhere. The water stations at the airports have the options "hot" and "warm" only. At first, I thought it must be that boiling purified the not-safe-to-drink Chinese tap water. I'd also grown up being told that hot drinks helped with stomach cramps whereas cold drinks worsened them (I always felt skeptical about this). So, health concern? I can't seem to find any solid explanation, but this East-West difference was never lost on me when a cup of hot water was handed to me in 90 degree weather.</li>
			<li><strong>No free napkins.</strong> You are expected to whip out your own napkins at all restaurants except for the fancy Westernized ones. If you left them at home, I guess you just find another way to deal with your food residue...</li>
			<li><strong>Squat toilets.</strong> Let's just say seeing a normal toilet in public was like finding a hidden treasure. And still no napkins here, at least most of the time.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>If my whiny undertone doesn't make it clear, these are things I simply wasn't familiar with and therefore were not in my comfort zone. Another unfamiliar thing to me was the sense of life just being so unorderly. Taxi drivers drive (from an American perspective) like madmen and in some cases, as we experienced, yell at pedestrians and other drivers like madmen. People push and shove to get where they need to be. Yet the lack of access to Google, Facebook, and other things that are the entirety of my online activity is just one example of how the Chinese people are definitely, to oversimplify, subject to some rules.</p>

		<p>This trip showed me just how unknowledgeable I am about a culture that I deem myself to come from (that I sure look like I come from) and that is so powerful in the world. Looks like I'll need much more than 2 weeks to help with that.</p>
