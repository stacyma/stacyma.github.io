		<p>Perhaps one of my biggest goals for this year was to take a good amount of time to travel, and a little while back, I did it! I spent a month traveling around Asia between Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, & Hong Kong with a friend. I've gotten various initial responses to this; for some, a month seems really long, for others it's not nearly long enough. For me, I felt a little of both -- some days I craved being back home in the comfort of my own bed, but other days (and definitely more often), I imagined a life where I traveled forever. Going into the details of a month of traveling here would be impossible, so here are some things I learned from 30 days of backpacking:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Bugs still love me as much as they always have</strong> - and<strong> </strong>my body still reacts to bites as terribly as it always has! In addition to my foot swelling to the point of not fitting into my sandal for about a week, it seems there are few places on my body that <i>weren't</i> bitten over the course of this trip (with the scars to unfortunately prove it). But with it being such a common occurrence, my tolerance at least grew a bit. (Thinking positively?)</li>
			<li><strong>Living cheaply is very possible, especially in (southeast) Asia</strong>. To rank the countries we traveled to from cheapest to most costly: Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, Hong Kong. We took all forms of transportation I can think of, including trains, planes, taxis, tuk-tuks, buses, ferries, and a lot of walking, and lived in all sorts of places, from shared hostel rooms, to guest houses, to hotels, to balance between being budget-friendly as well as safe and efficient with our time. In total, the costs of our flights took up about half of our spending, and everything else the other half - which turns out to be very fair for 30 days of travel.</li>
			<li><strong>Sweet, sweet simplicity</strong>. With 10 days' worth of clothes in my backpack and no data plan on my phone, I looked forward every day to doing something new and exciting, and it was more important for me to experience those things than to share them on social media in real time, or to look great every day for them (what is looking good in 90+ degrees and high humidity anyway?). You don't need a lot to enjoy a great moment.</li>
			<li><strong>Inevitably, traveling in third world countries had me reevaluating my lifestyle and counting my blessings several times</strong>. From a complete lack of sidewalks to kids staffing restaurants to the minimal wages locals spend a whole day working for...despite the beauty of these countries and their people, there is a side that shines a different light on the wealth of opportunities I have and the travels I'm able to take on. It was a mixed bag of feelings to hear about locals' hopes for the future and their vision of the place I live in as only dreams. For now, I can only hope for positive development in these countries and their people.</li>
			<li><strong>I was met with kindness and friendliness at many times throughout my trip</strong>, which is yet another reminder that a little bit of kindness-- a simple hello or a smile at a stranger--can go a long way.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Especially after meeting other travelers who'd been traveling for a year or more, I hope this isn't my last "big adventure." I got only a taste of everywhere I went and would happily revisit each place. There are far too many more places I want to venture to for my traveling to end here, it's just a matter of when the next time will be...</p>
