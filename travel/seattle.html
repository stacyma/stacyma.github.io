		<p>Instead of hitting up hot sandy beaches for my last ever college Spring Break, me and some of my closest friends from home took a 16 hour drive up north across half of California, Oregon, and Washington to see Seattle for the first time. But it wasn't as bad as it sounds- we were blessed with beautiful weather in the city if just a little chilly (even though I brought my winter jacket ready for Alaska-type-weather), and even the long drive there was fairly scenic (until the sun set and the rain started to pour):</p>


		<p>After finally reaching Seattle and getting our recovery sleep that night, we were lucky enough to have our very own Seattleite, Sunny, show us the city! Here were some of my personal favorites:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>The Seattle Central Library.</strong> This is one of the craziest if not <em>the</em> craziest designed library I've ever seen! I was lucky enough to have seen the Casa da Música in Porto, Portugal, designed by the same architect, Rem Koolhaas, and this library was just as awe-inducing. It had a similarly weird, spaceship-appearing-out-of-nowhere feel and the view from the inside was just as cool. Although, I could've done without looking down from the top (11th) floor.</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Cherry blossoms at the U-Dub quad.</strong> How lucky were we to catch the few weeks (?) that the cherry blossoms were blooming! Never have I seen so many cherry blossoms at once in my life.</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Pike Place Market.</strong> This. Market. Was seriously so overwhelming in food - which is the best kind of overwhelming, right? We had all kinds of chowder at the famous Pike Place Chowder, Russian smoked salmon pastries from the also famous Piroshky Piroshky, Rachel's Ginger Beer (I had the mango mate, yum - until the fizz gave out because I was drinking too slow), passionfruit macarons from Le Panier, and my definite favorite - Elleno's greek yogurt! I honestly don't believe this is greek yogurt because to me it just tasted like delicious, perfect cream, especially with the latte and lemon curd flavors I picked. The only tragedy is that it's a Seattle-only product. (Silent tears.)</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Riding the ferry to Bainbridge Island.</strong> We didn't actually step onto the island, unless you count getting off the ferry to get in line to get back on the ferry,  but we took the ferry for the sweet sunset views and... well maybe not for this, but the freezing cold winds at the front of the boat! It was definitely a special way to appreciate Seattle's mix of city and nature, both beautiful in their own rights. Nothing like feeling the wind in your hair on a moving boat. And yes, I did pay a little tribute to Derek Shepherd.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>And while there are no photos, what we saw of the bar scene in Seattle was also super lively and fun, which is what makes the "sleepless" part of our stay appropriate.</p>

		<p>So even with the chilliness (or maybe because of the sunny-ness), Seattle definitely caught my attention as a seriously beautiful and cool city. I only wish we had a little more time there, maybe just to explore more of that bomb food scene (or just get more Elleno's)! But luckily there's always next time. :)</p>
