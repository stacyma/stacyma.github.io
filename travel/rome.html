		<p>Time has been passing by too fast lately and December doesn't feel like December at all. Normally I'd be going all out on my finals study plan (with boba in hand) having returned from a weekend of Thanksgiving with family, catching up with friends, and Black Friday shopping with my mom, counting down the days to go home for Christmas. But here, Thanksgiving came and went oddly casually (the only time I'll ever have class on Thanksgiving). Luckily I had great company to have two "friendsgivings" with - somehow managing to find turkey both times (even if it means taking the remainder of the deli turkey at Waitrose). Maybe it's also the fact that I'm not going home for another month still, and instead of studying for exams I'm swamped with papers (which I am clearly trying to avoid).</p>

		<p>Here's more on Rome, my latest weekend trip:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>My history books came alive</strong>. Actually, I don't own any history books and I'm no history buff. But it was really crazy to have studied Ancient Rome at whatever part of my life and to actually be able to walk the grounds of the Coliseum, look through the oculus of the Pantheon, see the temple of Julius Caesar, and the castle of Hadrian's tomb, and the list goes on and on and on.</li>

			<li><strong>Churches, churches, and more churches. (Repeat with "art").</strong> Rome is full of fancy schmancy churches, many which look very simple on the outside and are unexpectedly extravagant on the inside. Even after seeing so many they wow'd me every time! With art, I became quickly familiar with Bernini and Caravaggio, with some Michelangelo and Raphael thrown in between (still, only half of the TMNT).</li>

			<li><strong>I went to the Vatican and did not see the Pope.</strong> (Everyone keeps asking me about that second part.) The Vatican Museums were really a lot to take in, and mostly overwhelming for me. Highlights like most people were the Raphael rooms and the Sistine Chapel (which probably would've been nicer if people actually followed the no talking/no photography rules). St. Peter's was enormous and I went into the Vatican Grottoes which is basically the underground of the church holding a bunch of tombs of past Pope's and that was weird.</li>

			<li><strong>Gelato</strong>. I had gelato all 3 days I was there which of course was in my plans. I also learned how to correctly say "pistachio." And yes it was the best gelato I've had in my life, particularly the pistachio and coffee flavors. Plus I had great local recommendations for coffee, pizza by weight, pasta, wine, etc...was a foodie dream.</li>

			<li><strong>Traveling alone is cool, for at least a short while.</strong> This was my first full solo weekend trip, and I'm so glad I did it. Pro's of solo travel are you can do whatever you want, at your own pace, without worry of being polite or being judged or whatever. It also pushes you to interact with more people than you otherwise might (or to take more selfies...). Still I realized that while I liked embracing the whole independence thing, a few days of solo travel are enough for me - great experiences, to me, are better when they can be shared and verbally reminisced on later. Even so traveling alone is a great experience in itself and I would do it again.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>I'm starting to get to that point where I feel used to living in London, I love it, but I also long for home every now and then. Sign of needing to head back soon, or stay longer?</p>
