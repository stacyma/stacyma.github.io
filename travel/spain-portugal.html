		<p>Going into 10 days of traveling in detail might bore anyone to death, so I'm going to try to limit myself to notable moments, good and bad (post-blog note: this still ended up being really long, whoops).</p>
		<h4>Barcelona</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Gaudí's architecture</strong>. La Sagrada Familia is truly something amazing - beyond its massive, intricately decorated exterior, the interior is breathtaking (and my favorite part) - giant stained glass windows flooding in colors to make you feel like you're walking through a rainbow... Hate to say it, but you had to be there. The other Gaudí highlight was Park Guell, which was full of Gaudi's creations mixed in with nature.</li>
			<li><strong>The view from Montjuic</strong>. We went here on our last day and actually almost didn't, as we weren't sure what we would find. Paying the 3€ to go into the castle and more importantly, the top of it, was well worth it to look across the amazingly blue Mediterranean Sea (and pretend I was in Greece at the same time).</li>
			<li><strong>Going tapas bar hopping on Blai street with new friends</strong>. We met Grace and Esther on our way to our hostel, and found that they were from California, studying at UCL, and had basically the exact same reading week travel plans as us- a little scary, but also awesome! We went out together, and basically 1-1.50€ tapas with comparably cheap drinks (including the Spanish champagne-type drink, cava) made for a good night.</li>
			<li><strong>Cutest brunch I've ever had at Brunch & Cake... with our (first) pickpocketing experience</strong>. I had the "superfood" meal, which consisted of a honey toast with delicious fruits on top like strawberries and starfruit, along with a little cup of chia seed banana pudding...and plated beautifully! Beats all hipster brunches I've ever had in California (and for cheaper). The major downer on this meal was when Soo reached for her bag which was hanging on the back of her chair and found that it was gone. To be clear, this restaurant was a nice place with proper-looking people, it was broad daylight, Ophelia was sitting next to her and I was sitting at an angle to her, and a bunch of Ophelia's friends were also at the table... And no one noticed anything. One win for Barcelona pickpocketers. Luckily Soo didn't lose her phone or passport, but it was still a huge, trip disturbing ordeal for Soo... We spent some time at the police station.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Porto</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>The layout, atmosphere and friendliness of the city</strong>. Here was where we discovered the beautiful, colored Portuguese tiling, tiny winding alleyways in between rustic houses, and sloping hills all leading down to the peaceful Duoro River. It felt like around every corner was a new and interesting picture, and every angle/viewpoint of Porto was absolutely spectacular. Also, the city had such a chill vibe that I felt relaxed just being there, especially on our first day which was a quiet Wednesday. I never felt unsafe in the quiet, and locals were generally very welcoming of us out-of-place-looking tourists, even through language barriers. When climbing up a super steep hill at night, two older women who lived along there tried "pulling" us up with an imaginary rope. We asked a store owner for the location of a restaurant and a customer offered to walk us there. Porto was like I met someone with both good looks and a personality I liked and fell in love.</li>
			<li><strong>Amazing, CHEAP food (not even talking London standards)</strong>. The best meal was at a place called O Caracas, which was run completely by a woman and her twin daughters (who ran around the small restaurant yelling out to each other), where they had two meal options a night only. I came out after 2 hours having eaten bread with DELICIOUS cheese, a huge plate of codfish and rice, dessert, and a few glasses of wine for about 12€. Like.... What. Coffee was about 1€ everywhere in Porto and while I'm no coffee expert, it beat any chain coffee store for sure. Pork sandwiches for 2€...and I could go on and on.</li>
			<li><strong>Drinking wine and watching a performance in the Casa Da Musica.</strong> Ophelia and I went on a tour at one of the 12 port wineries in Porto, this one called Ferreira. We got to learn about the wine, have a taste, and basically feel classy as hell. To add to the classiness, we bought spontaneous tickets to watch the Porto symphonic orchestra at the Casa Da Musica- a music hall with a crazy cool modern design, and the best part was the crazy old conductor with gray hair that looked permanently windblown as he traded off between conducting and playing oboe.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>It seemed like our 3 days in Porto were perfect, and it was my favorite of the 3 cities. I do have to admit that we had extensive local recommendations that might've made this city better than it would've been... but I like to think I would have loved it either way.</p>
		
		<h4>Lisbon</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>EGG TARTS. AKA pasteis de nata</strong>. We went to the OG of Portuguese egg tart shops, <i>Pastéis de Belém</i>, and were not disappointed. Besides having a cheerful waiter named Yonel, we had a total of 8 egg tarts, coffee, and spinach quiche, over a span of 2 hours. Now I've had Chinese egg tarts my whole life but this was a whole new experience! Crispy thin, flaky crust with a perfect-consistency warm custard inside...I feel true sadness thinking I might not find these anywhere else. Guess I'll have to come back.</li>
			<li><strong>The fairytale land of Sintra</strong>. Sintra is a town that's a 40 minute train ride away from Lisbon that contains huge expanses of green parks, with, most importantly, a bunch of palaces/castles. The Pena Palace was the most colorful palace I've seen in my life, literally looks like one out of the storybooks. Quinta da Regaleira was a palace and park with an Alice-in-Wonderland feel, leading you down random stairs or tunnels connecting you to different layers of the park. The town is a complete tourist haven, but the setup of it all still made me feel like I was in a faraway, peaceful place that I didn't want to leave. I was also able to make it out to Cabo da Roca, the westernmost point of continental Europe, to watch the sunset. Priceless.</li>
			<li><strong>Pickpocketing experience #2, with a happier ending</strong>. Walking back to our hostel one night, Ophelia felt her wallet being taken out of her bag. With only a few people around, this girl acted like a boss and went up to the suspicious looking dude who I pointed out had to have taken it and demanded "YOU STOLE MY WALLET" and that he show her his backpack (go Oph). With some local assistance, this guy's female partner in crime walked up and actually gave Ophelia her wallet back, trying to play it off like she had just found it on the ground... crisis averted, through a strange series of events. In retrospect it could've been a dangerous situation, so I'll say we were also pretty lucky. I think the biggest lesson here is to avoid making yourself an easy target = for female travelers, clutch your bags for dear life everywhere you go.</li>
		</ul>
		 
		<h3>Other things:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>The euro to dollar exchange rate</strong>. It was nearly 1 to 1 and only got better as the trip went on... internally crying now that I've returned to the pound and London.</li>
			<li><strong>Three things I consumed nearly every day</strong>: coffee, ice cream, and alcohol. ;)</li>
			<li><strong>Being Asian-American</strong>. Living my whole life in California and now the very international London, this might be one of the first times I landed myself into a place where my appearance made me such an object of curiosity. I know I'm just defining Asian-American here, but I realized how strange it was to others for me to not be the same as the selfie-stick carrying tourists from China, but also not the white American traveler. Looking Asian made me a minority, but being Asian-<em>American</em> seemed to multiply that minority-ness by tenfold. Some instances I attributed to honest curiosity, few to intended racism. Nevertheless, this never made me particularly uncomfortable or appalled, I just eventually found it to be inevitable.</li>
			<li><strong>Terrorist attacks</strong>. I'll save you from reading another expression of devastation [<i>referring to Paris bombings</i>]. The main way this impacted me is that I've never felt so close to such a situation before. From London, Paris is just a train ride away. It was reading week. Many UCL students headed to Paris, and it just as easily could have been me. I can't even begin to understand the complexity behind the attacks, but I can understand a little bit of the fear. It worries me to live in central London, maybe the next closest and most major city - but I know this kind of worry will get me nowhere. Instead I'm choosing to feel thankful for being safe and my loved ones for being safe also. And rooting for the good in the world to beat the evil.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Back to London, back to the cold, time to get started on my 5 essays. I can't believe I'll be officially done with term a month from today...</p>
