		<p>I've been compiling this blog post throughout the past few weeks or so and wanted to wait until I got through the thick of my secondaries to post it. I have yet to find out if I did it "right" but I do know I've made it out alive. So here are some of my recommended steps to staying sane through the medical or any other similarly overwhelming application process (at least the writing part of it):</p>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Work in public</strong> - libraries, cafes, anywhere with fresh air, good light, and strangers.</li>
			<li><strong>Take. Breaks.</strong> My favorite break activities are: physical activity (even if it's just a walk), Netflix (preferably something funny and light), hanging with friends who understand (they will keep you sane, seriously) - maybe even take a trip to the aquarium with them to sit in a dark and quite peaceful room among some big fish.</li>
			<li><strong>Do not go onto forum websites (aka, SDN)</strong> unless you are desperate for some very possibly subjective information and/or stress-inducing anxiety. If you must, take what you read with a grain of salt.</li>
			<li><strong>Utilize your resources for help.</strong> No matter how confident you are, have others look over your writing and give you honest criticism, especially when you're just starting to figure out how to answer these types of questions. And if you have any connections, as distant as they may be, use those to help you as well.</li>
			<li><strong>Review your apps and submit them in the morning.</strong> Your head will be clearer then.</li>
			<li><strong>Unless you are a very perfect or a very lucky human being, obstacles will fly your way.</strong> In hopes that this will make someone out there feel better, here is a track record of the mistakes I've already made (pending more):
		<ul>
			<li>I filled out <em>last year'</em>s primary application and didn't realize it until I was just about to "submit." Yep.</li>
			<li>One of my critical letter writers unexpectedly lagged, causing me to send out emergency emails late in the game.</li>
			<li>Another of my critical letter writers didn't submit their letter on the required letterhead, and I failed to check for this earlier.</li>
			<li>I missed the part that says "do not copy and paste from Word" and ended up submitting, irreversibly, a secondary where all my apostrophe's and dashes turned into question marks. Yep.</li>
			<li>I made a spelling mistake in a word I had submitted for multiple secondary questions.</li>
		</ul>
		Did I freak out at least a little with each one of these? Yes, some more than others. But if I wasn't able to resolve the issue or let it resolve itself, I forced myself to come to terms with it as soon as possible. I hope you won't make these mistakes, but if you don't <em>still</em> make these you'll probably make other mistakes by the rules of probability in writing too many essays for too many schools all at once. All I have learned in telling myself "Be more careful next time, Stacy" and "It's okay, you are human, Stacy" is this: Handle challenges as they come to the best of your ability, and let go of what you cannot control.
		</li></ol>

		<p>What most people have been telling me when they see me in exhaustion is "It'll be worth it in the end!" When you're on this side, it can sometimes seem like a measly comment of encouragement. But the truth is, they're right, and that is exactly what is pulling me through. Learning more about the possibilities of the direction I will go in for 4 years of my life has been pretty dang exciting... so here's to hoping for the best in the next stage of this crazy ride!</p>
