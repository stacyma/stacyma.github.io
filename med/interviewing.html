		<h1>interviewing</h1>
		</center>

		<p>After this seemingly long interview season spanning two (or more?) <em>actual</em> seasons, I'll be candid that I've gone to a grand total of three interviews (two traditional and one MMI). My only potential source of credibility is that the two I've heard back from seemed to go well. So yeah, nobody's calling me a pro. But even with my limited experience, here are some things that I feel are important (or at least were for me) for not freaking the hell out on interview day.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Practice, practice, practice.</strong> I'm often home alone in the morning so I took that time to interview with the air, or on my 25-minute commute to and from work. It really is different speaking out loud (even to no one) than it is to merely write out or think in your head what you would say. And what exactly to practice? To start, make sure you can answer general questions ("Tell me about yourself", "Why do you want to be a doctor?", etc. - not as easy as you might think). Get informed on common medical issues, read books if you have the time. And if you're prepping for an MMI, practice MMI-style questions and time yourself accordingly. They say to expect the unexpected, but you <em>can</em> prepare for themes that come up often.</li>
			<li><strong>Know your "core experiences".</strong> Obviously you should know everything on your app backwards and forwards. But for the few experiences you know there is a high chance of coming up or you making use of for a broad range of questions (e.g. your <em>most significant</em> leadership/teamwork experience, research experience, volunteer experience), really practice summarizing the experiences and talking about what you got out of them until you can do so concisely and eloquently. This came in handy for me the most.</li>
			<li><strong>Have a point in what you're saying and make that point clear.</strong> Don't just state your accomplishments like you're checking off a list; that's boring and expected. Know what you're trying to convey (which should probably be minimal for any given response) and lay it out there with conviction.</li>
			<li><strong>Mock interview with someone you don't know</strong>, preferably someone in medicine. Doing a mock interview with a medical student who was a complete stranger to me helped a lot more than I expected. First of all, I was so (irrationally?) nervous for this that getting through it gave me confidence for my first interview. Second of all, I got constructive feedback on how I come across that I perhaps wouldn't get from someone who knows me well and is used to my tendencies. Tip #2 came from him.</li>
			<li><strong>Know the 4 basic principles of medical ethics.</strong> For any aspiring physician, these basic moral principles in medicine are <em>probably</em> important to know (and to show a basic understanding of in your interviews). This will take you all of 2 minutes to read up on, and especially for the MMI, knowing these guided me in discussing and making decisions for situational questions.</li>
			<li><strong>Be as informed as possible.</strong> Get in contact with friends you know attending the school you're about to interview at, or even friends of friends. Don't be shy! Most likely, they will want to help you. Doing some digging online can sometimes help too (just try your best to avoid falling into a hole of self-deprecation that can also come with online digging).</li>
			<li><strong>Be yourself. Don't overthink it. And take a deep breath (or multiple).</strong> If you're like me, your nerves will make you smile already, but if not, you might try breaking out a smile to calm yourself down. I've said some borderline ridiculous or irrelevant things my interviews, but I'd like to think that doing so (to an extent, of course) helped express who I am far more effectively than presenting myself as a 100% put-together person who I am not. Formulating and rehearsing answers beforehand can only go so far; I think it is better to come across as a human being (faults and all) than as a suspiciously well-oiled machine.</li>
			<li><strong>Be on your best behavior.</strong> It blew my mind when I heard other applicants on interview day blatantly discussing their previous interview experiences openly and negatively... while I can't say for sure how much anything outside of the interview setting "matters", you never know what role anyone you encounter may play. 
			<li><strong>Remember that you're seeing if the school is right for you as well.</strong>While it's easy to be overwhelmed by interview nerves, it's also important to remember to take in the feel of the school and its students, and consider whether you can truly see yourself there, as you may not have the chance again until you have to make a decision.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>I've been told that interviewing is 45% body language, 45% <em>how</em> you say things, and only 10% <em>what</em> you say. In my experience, this seems to more often than not prove itself true. I know, I know, I'm making it all sound easier than it seems - but you can only prep so much before you just go through it yourself and eventually find yourself feelin' okay. Remind yourself to be calm, be confident, be you, and things will fall into place the way they are meant to.</p>
